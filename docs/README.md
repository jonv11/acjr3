# Documentation

Use this index to find small, task-focused docs.

## Start paths

- New to the project: `docs/getting-started.md`
- Setting environment variables: `docs/configuration.md`
- Looking for command syntax: `docs/commands/README.md`
- Shell completion examples: `docs/commands/completion.md`
- Scenario playbooks: `docs/use-cases/README.md`
- Understanding runtime behavior: `docs/behavior.md`
- Navigating source/tests: `docs/codebase-structure.md`

## Principles

- Keep docs short.
- Keep examples runnable.
- Prefer linking over duplicating content.
- Keep docs aligned with current code in `src/acjr3`.
